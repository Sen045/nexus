/** The language bank acts as a cache for languages, indexed by name.
 *
 *  To each language name we associate a tuple (f,s,l), where f is the
 *  path to the file containing the language, s is a description of the language and l
 *  is either the cached language or NONE. If l is NONE, this means that the dictionary
 *  associated with the language has not yet been constructed. This construction will be
 *  triggered when the dictionary is requested by a client, and will then be cached to speed
 *  up future requests.
 *
 *  The language bank also has a default dictionary.
 *
 *  While this approach sacrifices both immutability and some locality by storing languages
 *  in a globally accessible structure, the intention is to save memory by avoiding multiple
 *  copies of the same dictionary in memory, while also making sure that tries for each
 *  dictionary need not be constructed more than once.
